# Recommendation-System-Ecommerce.

E-commerce companies use recommendation systems to provide personalized product or service suggestions to customers in order to improve their shopping experience and increase sales. These systems use data on customer behavior, such as previous purchases and browsing history, to make recommendations based on their individual preferences and interests.

Recommendation systems can be divided into two main categories: content-based and collaborative filtering. Content-based systems use information about the characteristics of the products or services being recommended, such as their descriptions and tags, to make recommendations. Collaborative filtering systems, on the other hand, use information about how other users with similar interests have interacted with the products or services in order to make recommendations.
